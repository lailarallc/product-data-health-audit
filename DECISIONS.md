# Decisions Log

Durable choices with rationale. These should hold across future sessions.

### 2026-05-20 — Shiny defaults use field-presence pass rate (60%), not strict validation (0%)

- **Why:** The strict check in `R/02_build_frames.R` (GTIN check-digit verification + OneWorldSync registration) produces a 0% pass rate for the 50-SKU dataset — every SKU fails at least one validation. A 0% default makes the calculator's sensitivity slider useless since there's no room to explore scenarios. The 60% field-presence rate better represents what a real company would self-report when using the tool.
- **Scope:** `shiny/app.R` default values for pass_rate slider on both Calculator and Cost of Delay tabs.
- **Do not:** Change the default to 0% even though strict validation produces that number. The Shiny app is a general-purpose tool, not a mirror of Cinderhaven's strict audit results.

### 2026-05-20 — GitHub Pages must deploy `_files/` directories alongside Quarto HTML

- **Why:** Quarto renders with `embed-resources: false` for both `report.qmd` and `dashboard.qmd`. The HTML files depend on their corresponding `_files/` directories for CSS, JS, fonts, and interactive widgets (ggiraph, reactable). Without these directories, the pages load with no styling, no interactivity, and no images.
- **Scope:** `.github/workflows/render.yml`, "Assemble Pages site" step. Applies to any future Quarto HTML artifact added to the site.
- **Do not:** Switch to `embed-resources: true` as a workaround — it bloats file sizes and breaks widget interactivity. Always copy the `_files/` directory when adding a new HTML artifact to the Pages deployment.

### 2026-05-22 — UNFI removal: filter at earliest pipeline stage

- **Why:** UNFI is a distributor, not a retailer. Rather than filtering at each downstream consumer (charts, tables, narrative), filter all source tables immediately after raw load in `02_build_frames.R`. Every frame, chart, and report inherits the exclusion automatically.
- **Scope:** `R/02_build_frames.R` (lines 43-47), plus removal from `R/00_theme.R` retailer_colors, `R/04_hero_charts.R` contracted vector, `R/05_supporting_charts.R` chart 6 + chart 12, `R/06_excel_workbook.R` data dictionary, and all `.qmd` narrative references.
- **Do not:** Re-add UNFI or add other distributors to the retailer analysis. The analysis covers all six retailers in the dataset: Walmart, Costco, Whole Foods, Kroger, Sprouts, Regional Group.

### 2026-05-22 — Chargeback reason remap in 02_build_frames.R

- **Why:** Raw DB reason codes (`label_fine`, `pricing_error`, `damaged`, `late_delivery`, `short_ship`) need human-readable names for charts, narratives, and the fix-ROI calculation. The mapping was originally set to analytical categories ("Invalid GTIN/UPC", "Missing product data", "Dimension mismatch") but was changed to honest, transparent names that match what each reason actually represents in the data.
- **Mapping:** `label_fine`→"Label / barcode fine", `pricing_error`→"Pricing error", `damaged`→"Damaged goods", `late_delivery`→"Late delivery", `short_ship`→"Short shipment".
- **Scope:** `R/02_build_frames.R` (lines 50-56). All downstream code expects the human-readable names.
- **Do not:** Change the mapping without also updating `R/04_hero_charts.R` `amt_18()`, `R/05_supporting_charts.R` chart 14, and `quarto/report.qmd` `data_defect_pct`.

### 2026-05-22 — SVG for HTML, PNG for PDF via format-conditional chart() helper

- **Why:** SVG gives crisp vector charts in the HTML report. But PDF rendering requires `rsvg-convert` to convert SVG→PDF for LaTeX, and it's not installed. Hardcoding either format breaks the other.
- **Scope:** `quarto/report.qmd` setup chunk defines `chart(name)` which returns `.svg` for HTML and `.png` for PDF. Both `save_chart()` and `save_pair()` now generate SVG alongside PNG. Tearsheet keeps hardcoded `.png` paths (PDF-only document).
- **Do not:** Set `dev: "svglite"` globally in `_quarto.yml` — it breaks PDF. Don't replace the `chart()` helper with static paths unless `rsvg-convert` is installed system-wide.

### 2026-05-20 — Charts use Lailara Design System tokens, not hardcoded colors

- **Why:** Charts should look like part of the Lailara portfolio. All non-focal elements use greyscale tokens (`LL_RECEDE`, `LL_RECEDE_DARK`), backgrounds use `LL_CANVAS`, and red accent (`LL_RED_42`) is reserved for the single focal data point per chart.
- **Scope:** `R/00_theme.R`, `R/04_hero_charts.R`, `R/05_supporting_charts.R`. Applies to any future chart added.
- **Do not:** Use hardcoded hex greys (`#B0B0B0`, `#888888`, etc.) or white backgrounds in chart code. Always reference the semantic token from `R/00_theme.R`.

### 2026-05-22 — Narrative rewrite: every claim must match the data

- **Why:** The original report.qmd narrative made claims the synthetic dataset does not support: varied defect types, quality tiers with spread, entry-path analysis, stalled-launch and shelf-loss cost estimates, 3-retailer scope, and hardcoded SKU names. The rewrite ensures every sentence is backed by what the data actually contains.
- **Scope:** `quarto/report.qmd` (all 4 parts, ~960 lines), `quarto/tearsheet.qmd`. Affects setup chunk variables, inline R expressions, section headings, and prose throughout.
- **Key changes:** Expanded from 3 to 6 retailers. Removed quality-tier analysis (DQ score = 75 for all 50 SKUs, zero variance). Removed entry-path analysis (updated_by is NA for all records). Removed stalled-launch and shelf-loss cost estimates (no supporting data). Changed hardcoded CHP-0002/CHP-0044 references to dynamically computed top_rev/top_cb SKUs.
- **Do not:** Add narrative claims about data patterns without first verifying the pattern exists in the analytical frames. The dataset is synthetic and intentionally limited.

### 2026-05-22 — Removed unsupported cost estimates

- **Why:** `stalled_launch_cost` and `shelf_loss_cost` were fabricated estimates with no backing data in the dataset. The report should only make dollar claims it can trace to actual records.
- **Scope:** `quarto/report.qmd` setup chunk (variables removed), Part 1 narrative (sections removed), Part 4 methodology (estimates removed from total).
- **Do not:** Re-introduce aggregate cost estimates that combine measured chargebacks with modeled/assumed costs unless the model is documented in the methodology section.

### 2026-05-22 — Barcode validator uses GS1-standard weights, not dataset-generator weights

- **Why:** The previous EAN-13-style weights `(1,3,1,3,...)` matched the synthetic data generator but violated the GS1 spec for GTIN-14. The difference in failure rates (90% vs ~81%) is acceptable — the report uses dynamic inline R and adapts automatically.
- **Scope:** `R/barcode_validators.R`, `mod10_check_digit()`. Applies to GTIN-14 and UPC-A validation.
- **Do not:** Revert to EAN-13 weights to match the dataset generator. If the synthetic data needs regenerating, generate it with correct GS1 weights instead.

### 2026-05-22 — Retailer readiness excludes SSOT-absent fields

- **Why:** The `retailer_requirements` table references fields (`allergen_statement`, `nutrition_facts`, `product_image`, `sds_sheet`, `serving_size`) that do not exist in the raw `product_master`. Left-joining these against `field_evals` produced NAs, which `coalesce(passes, FALSE)` silently converted to failures — making every SKU fail every retailer. Fields with name mismatches (`case_dimensions`, `unit_weight`) compounded the problem.
- **Scope:** `R/02_build_frames.R` lines 201-236. The `required_fields` frame now remaps `case_dimensions` → `case_dims`, `unit_weight` → `unit_weight_lbs`, and filters out the 5 absent fields.
- **Do not:** Re-add absent fields to the readiness check. If the SSOT is updated to include these columns, add them back to `field_evals` and remove the filter exclusion at the same time.

### 2026-05-22 — UPC validation accepts 12-digit UPC-A and 13-digit EAN-13

- **Why:** The SSOT has 13-digit UPC codes (EAN-13 format). The original `is_valid_upc12()` required exactly 12 digits, failing every SKU. Added `is_valid_upc()` that checks both formats. Narrative references changed from "UPC-12" to "UPC" throughout.
- **Scope:** `R/barcode_validators.R` (new `is_valid_upc` function), `R/02_build_frames.R` (uses `is_valid_upc` for both `upc_valid` and `field_evals`), `quarto/report.qmd` and `quarto/tearsheet.qmd` (all "UPC-12" → "UPC").
- **Do not:** Remove `is_valid_upc12()` — it's still used by `tests/test_mod10.R`.

### 2026-05-22 — One-week fix timeline (down from two weeks)

- **Why:** With only barcode defects to fix (no case dimensions, no missing product data fields), the action plan shrinks from 4 phases / 14 days to 3 phases / 5 days. The fix scope is: correct UPC-12 and GTIN-14 check digits, add a validation gate, deploy monitoring.
- **Scope:** `quarto/report.qmd` Part 3 action plan, `quarto/tearsheet.qmd` "A one-week turnaround" section.
- **Do not:** Expand the timeline without adding corresponding fix actions backed by actual defects in the data.

### 2026-06-21 — Option B for CHP-AS-009: rewrite narrative, do NOT change Postgres SSOT

- **Why:** After the Cinderhaven data reseed, CHP-AS-009 (Truffle Mushroom Sauce) now has DQ score 100.0, $0 chargebacks, and 6/6 retailer pass rate. The narrative sections that use it as the "your best-seller is your biggest hidden risk" showcase contradict the data. The decision is to rewrite the narrative around a different showcase SKU that actually has defects, rather than corrupting the database to match old prose.
- **Scope:** `quarto/report.qmd` sections "The $X-a-month problem nobody sees" and "The SKU you can't afford to ignore"; `quarto/tearsheet.qmd` "The crown jewel" section. All use `top_rev` (dynamically computed #1 revenue SKU).
- **Division of labor:** Claude Chat rewrites all narrative prose (Economist style). Claude Code provides the updated figures and candidate showcase SKU after pipeline re-run, then integrates the new prose into the Quarto source and re-renders.
- **Do not:** Modify `raw_tables.rds`, the Postgres SSOT, or any dbt models to re-introduce defects into CHP-AS-009.

### 2026-06-21 — Triage sort: chargeback-bearing SKUs first

- **Why:** `fix_priority_score` weights revenue 40%, putting high-revenue/$0-chargeback SKUs (CHP-PS-006, CHP-DG-004) at positions #1-#2 in triage tables. The tearsheet, report, dashboard, and Excel workbook all show $0 savings and $0/hr for the top-ranked items, undermining the ROI argument.
- **Scope:** All four triage table sorts: `report.qmd`, `tearsheet.qmd`, `dashboard.qmd`, `R/06_excel_workbook.R`. Sort is now `desc(chargeback_total > 0), desc(fix_priority_score)` — chargeback-bearing SKUs first, then by composite priority within each tier.
- **Do not:** Change `fix_priority_score` formula itself — it's still valid as a general-purpose composite. The sort change is display-level only.

### 2026-06-21 — Chart color encoding rule: color = information, not decoration

- **Why:** Multiple charts used different hues for single-series bars (one metric across categories) or multi-hue palettes for ordinal scales. This violates the principle that color should encode information the reader can't already get from labels. Decorative color adds cognitive load without adding meaning.
- **Scope:** All charts in `R/04_hero_charts.R` and `R/05_supporting_charts.R`. Applies to any future chart.
- **Rules:**
  - Single-series (one metric, multiple categories) = one fill color (Chicago-20), optionally highlight the most important bar (Tokyo-40).
  - Ordinal scale (ranked tiers) = single-hue sequential gradient (darkest = most severe, lightest = least).
  - Only true categorical comparisons (data-defect type A vs B, retailer A vs retailer B in multi-series) get multiple distinct hues.
- **Do not:** Add color variety "to make charts more visually interesting." If the x-axis or label already identifies the category, the bar color is decoration. Remove it.

### 2026-06-22 — Part 4 methodology: single collapsible section, not individual callouts

- **Why:** 8 separate collapsible callouts created visual noise, inconsistent expand/collapse state, and forced readers to hunt for specific methodology topics. A single collapsible section with ## subsection headings inside is scannable when open and unobtrusive when collapsed.
- **Scope:** `quarto/report.qmd` Part 4 (lines ~727–896). The outer fence is `:::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}`, inner `:::` fences handle PDF `\newpage` blocks.
- **Do not:** Split Part 4 back into individual callouts. If new methodology topics are added, add them as ## headings inside the existing collapsible section.

### 2026-06-22 — Dynamic inline R over hardcoded dollar figures in narrative

- **Why:** The post-reseed data changed every dollar figure in the report. Three hardcoded "$228,845" survived undetected until a human caught the discrepancy. Dozens more hardcoded figures ($896,803, $56,502, $18,834, $7,976, etc.) required manual replacement. Dynamic `ds(annual_cb)`, `ds(dg007$ttm_revenue)`, etc. make the prose self-updating when the data changes.
- **Scope:** `quarto/report.qmd` (section headings, inline prose, comparison figures), `quarto/dashboard.qmd`, `quarto/tearsheet.qmd` (where Quarto inline R is supported). `index.html` remains hardcoded (static HTML, no R engine).
- **Do not:** Hardcode dollar figures in `.qmd` prose when a computed variable exists. If Quarto inline R can't reach the value (e.g., inside a `fig-alt` string), hardcode but add a comment with the variable name so grep can find it on next data refresh.

### 2026-06-22 — Post-reseed Postgres data is canonical ($146,961 annual)

- **Why:** The June 2026 Cinderhaven data reseed changed underlying chargeback distribution. The committed raw_tables.rds at HEAD was from the pre-reseed database ($228,845 annual). The current Postgres/SQLite database produces $146,961 annual. User confirmed: current database is SSOT.
- **Scope:** All pipeline outputs, all report prose, all deployed artifacts. The pre-reseed $228,845 figure is retired.
- **Do not:** Revert to pre-reseed data or treat the committed raw_tables.rds at HEAD as authoritative. Always regenerate from the current database.

### 2026-06-22 — Dashboard reactables: fullWidth=TRUE + minWidth columns

- **Why:** `fullWidth = FALSE` adds the `rt-inline` class (display: inline-flex), which constrains the table to its content width and prevents it from filling the container. Combined with fixed `width` column parameters, headers get truncated when the total exceeds the container. `fullWidth = TRUE` removes `rt-inline`; `minWidth` (not `width`) sets a floor but allows columns to grow with available space.
- **Scope:** All three tabs in `quarto/dashboard.qmd`. Tab 2 was already `fullWidth = TRUE`; tabs 1 and 3 were changed this session.
- **Do not:** Use `fullWidth = FALSE` or fixed `width` on dashboard reactable columns. If a table needs to be narrower than its container, constrain via `minWidth` values and let the table self-size.

### 2026-06-22 — Dashboard table overflow: visible on .Reactable, auto on .reactable

- **Why:** Reactable's `.Reactable` div has `overflow: hidden` by default, which clips any inner `.rt-table` wider than the container — even if `min-width` is set. The fix is to set `.Reactable { overflow: visible }` so the table can expand, and `.reactable { overflow-x: auto }` on the outer wrapper so the browser provides a horizontal scrollbar. The scroll container must be outside the hidden boundary.
- **Scope:** `quarto/assets/dashboard.css`. Applies to all reactable tables in the dashboard.
- **Do not:** Set `overflow: hidden` or `overflow: auto` on `.Reactable` (inner wrapper). Horizontal scroll must be on `.reactable` (outer wrapper) or `.reactable-container`.

### 2026-06-21 — Revenue-at-risk table: fix vectorization bug

- **Why:** `rev_at_risk(retailer)` in the report's rr-summary-table chunk was called vectorized inside `transmute`, receiving all 6 retailer names at once instead of one at a time. The recycled `==` comparison produced a near-total join, returning ~$18.9M for every retailer regardless of their actual failure count.
- **Scope:** `quarto/report.qmd` line 211. Fix: wrap in `sapply()`.
- **Do not:** Remove the `rev_at_risk()` function — it's correct when called with a single retailer name.

### 2026-07-31 — Data-quality score counts barcode *validity*, not length
- **Why:** `checks_passed_6` in `R/02_build_frames.R` keyed on barcode length (`nchar==14`, `%in% c(12,13)`), so SKUs with an invalid check digit scored a perfect 100 — contradicting the documented methodology ("GTIN-14 valid, UPC valid") and the `issue_count` line directly above it (which uses `gtin_valid`/`upc_valid`). A product-data-health score that ignores barcode validity is indefensible for this tool.
- **Scope:** `R/02_build_frames.R` `checks_passed_6` uses `gtin_valid`/`upc_valid`. All DQ-tier prose (report methodology, pattern section, tearsheet) is now dynamic (`dq_min`, `n_dq_100`) so distribution claims can't drift.
- **Do not:** Revert to length-based checks. If the score definition changes, update the dynamic vars, not hardcoded tier counts.

### 2026-07-31 — Retailer P&L annualizes chargebacks to match TTM revenue
- **Why:** `retailer_pnl` subtracted the full multi-month `chargeback_total` from trailing-twelve-month revenue, overstating chargeback-%-of-revenue ~3x and making per-retailer rates irreconcilable with the report's ~0.43% headline.
- **Scope:** `R/02_build_frames.R` `retailer_pnl` — `chargeback_annual = chargeback_total * 12 / n_chargeback_months` drives `net_contribution` and `chargeback_pct_of_revenue`.
- **Do not:** Mix a multi-month chargeback numerator with a 12-month revenue denominator in any P&L. Keep both on the same clock.

### 2026-08-03 — Approved golden re-baselines from the client-mode narrative-drift work (Shawn)
- **Why:** The client-mode conversion (`client-mode-2026-08`) replaced several hardcoded prose claims with computed text. Three of these changed *published* wording on deploy, so they are not "drift" — they are corrections Shawn explicitly approved as the new golden after the R-host verifications (`PDHA-RENDER-VERIFICATION.md`, `-2.md`). Each was verified against the frames.
- **Approved corrections (the golden now matches these):**
  1. **Dashboard net-margin ranks** — Walmart #4 → **#6**, Whole Foods #1 → **#3** (computed `rrank()` over `retailer_pnl`; the old hardcoded ranks were stale).
  2. **Dashboard quick-wins** — "two hours / $9,000–$16,000 per fix-hour" → **4.0 h / $12.4k–$17.8k** (computed from the top-6 `savings_per_hour`; old figures were stale).
  3. **report.qmd country-of-origin sentence (~line 442)** — "…brand owner, country of origin (with one exception), and case weight are complete across the catalog." → **"brand owner is present on all `r n_skus`, country of origin is blank on `r n_ctry_fix`, and case weight is complete."** Verified against the frame: brand_owner blank 0/50, country_of_origin blank 1/50, case measurements complete. The golden's "complete … (with one exception)" was self-contradictory.
- **Do not:** Treat these three as regressions in a golden diff. They are the new baseline; the golden files/screenshots should be re-captured to include them before the next push/deploy.

### 2026-08-04 — Fabricated demo/fixture data uses canonical-sourced or obviously-fictional names, never real third parties
- **Why:** Two separate sessions put invented names into committed demo/fixture surfaces — "Cinderhaven Foods" (wrong brand, a retired canonical token, in 5 repos' `engagement.demo.yml`) and "Wegmans" (a real chain fabricated as a fixture retailer — 84 canonical-drift hits on the flagship PR). Real names in fabricated data assert false things about real companies and correctly trip the drift gate.
- **Scope:** `engagement.demo.yml` AND test fixtures / synthetic client data across the portfolio. Demo brand identity (name, short_name, revenue, roster) is **copied from `reference/canonical_values.json`**; synthetic non-demo names are clearly-invented placeholders in the "Regional Group" style.
- **Do not:** Type a client or retailer name from memory when building a demo config or fixture. Do **not** allowlist a real-company name that appears in fabricated data — **rename it** (the allowlist is only for legitimate research *about* the real company, e.g. deduction-practice notes). Codified in `ENGAGEMENT-READY-CHECKLIST.md` §3/§4, `engagement.example.yml`, and the Prompt 2 conversion procedure.
